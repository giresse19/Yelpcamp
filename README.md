# Yelpcamp
Yelpcamp is a simple application build in node.js using expresse framework for back-end and a semantic UI for front-end. This application allows users
to be able to share photos, description, description, price and names of their various camping grounds meanwhile others can view them or add
comments.
Authentication: a user has to have an account inorder to be able to post a camping ground or comment on any other user's camping ground.
Authorization: only users who post comments/camping grounds can delete or edit their comments/camping grounds. others can just view without even seeing
the delete/edit button.

the URl for the running application which is currently running can be found on my heroku account:
